        <a href="../index.html">Return to main</a>
            <p>Refreshing, rich, and healthy, this recipe makes a simple weeknight meal and showcases the best that spring has to offer. There's no need to be intimidated by hollandaise sauce in this recipe -- we use a blender or food processor to make this a breeze!</p>
            <p>I love serving oily fish like trout and salmon with asparagus in the spring. Asparagus is fickle and can go from tender to mushy quickly. The solution? A microwave sauna.</p>
            <p>Pair this entree with a fresh spring Mesclun Salad and our Blueberry-Lemon Pound Cake for a delightful three-course meal you can entertain friends and family with!</p>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Parchment Salmon and New Potatoes:</h3>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><br>
            <li>Cut 4 (14 inch) squares of parchment paper. Fold each in half. Then, unfold and lay each flat. Top half of each parchment square with one fish filet. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and a pinch of the lemon zest. Divide the potatoes evenly among each parchment square and arrange around and on top of the fish. Drizzle with 1 Tbsp each of olive oil, the juice of 1/4 lemon, and wine. Sprinkle a large pinch of chopped herbs.</li><br>
            <li>Fold empty half of parchment over filling. Beginning at one short end, fold edges up and tightly over themselves, working your way around the rectangle. Transfer packets to a sheet pan. Bake 15-20 minutes or until puffed and golden brown. The potatoes should be fork tender, and the trout should no longer be translucent and flake easily with a fork.</li><br>

            <p>While the fish is in the oven, prepare the hollandaise sauce and asparagus.</p>

            <h3>Blender Hollandaise:</h3>
            <li>Melt the butter slowly in a small pot. Try not to let it boil -- you want the moisture in the butter to remain there and not steam away.</li><br>
            <li>Add the egg yolks, lemon juice, 1/4 tsp of the salt, and cayenne (if using) into your blender or food processor. Blend the egg yolk mixture for 30 seconds at a medium high speed, until it lightens in color. <strong>Use a timer or count out loud, blending for the entire 30 seconds.</strong> This step gives the sauce more body.
            <p>The friction generated by the blender blades will heat the yolks a bit. The blending action will also introduce a little air into them, making your hollandaise a bit lighter.</p></li><br>
            <li>Transfer the melted butter to a glass measuring cup with a spout so it's easy to pour in a thin stream. Remove the plug from the blender lid. Turn the blender speed to low (if you only have one speed, or are using a food processor, this will still work). With the machine running, slowly drizzle in the melted butter.
            <p>Continue to blend for another couple seconds after the butter is all incorporated.</p></li><br>
            <li>Turn the blender off and taste the sauce. It should be buttery, lemony, and just lightly salty. If it isn't salty or lemony enough, you can add a little more lemon juice or the remaining salt to taste.
            <p>If you want a thinner consistency, add a little warm water. Pulse briefly to incorporate the ingredients one more time.</p></li><br>
            <li>Store until neeeded in a warm spot, such as next to the stovetop. Use within 30 minutes or less.</li><br>

            <h3>Steamed Asparagus:</h3>
            <li>Wash asparagus, then taking two or three stalks at a time, bend the base of the stalk until it snaps off. This should be easily done, and will ensure each bite is tender. Discard bottom bits that were snapped off.</li><br>
            <li>Take several squares of paper towels and lay on a dinner plate. Place asparagus on the paper towels diagonally. Dollop with butter. Tuck the corners over the ends of the asparagus and roll up, like a burrito.</li><br>
            <li>Douse with water. Conversely, you can dampen the paper towels beforehand, but the order here does not matter much.</li><br>
            <li>Microwave on HIGH for 5-6 minutes (less if your microwave is higher wattage; more if it is lower).</li><br>
            <li>Unwrap; discard paper towel. Arrange asparagus on a serving platter or portion on individual plates. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve with the fish, potatoes, and Hollandaise. </li>
