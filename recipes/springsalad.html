        <img src="springmix.jpeg" width="600" alt="Spring mix salad - an array of tender baby greens and dark violet leaves">
        <p><i>This salad uses tender baby greens and seasonal veggies. Simple enough to make every day, yet sophisticated enough to serve to guests. Pair with a versatile homemade dressing, which is cheaper, healthier, and more delicious than any store bought dressing.</p>
        <p>Spring mix is very delicate. If you would like to store this salad for later, do not add the dressing directly to the serving bowl; rather, drizzle on individual portions and leave the rest of the salad dry to prevent wilting.</i></p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>For the dressing:</h3>
            <aside>Makes about 3/4 cup</aside><br>
            <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard, smooth or grainy</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp plus 1 tsp wine vinegar - white, red, or champagne</li>
            <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp expeller-pressed flaxseed oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp finely chopped fresh herbs, such as parsley, tarragon, thyme, basil, dill, or oregano</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, peeled and mashed, optional</li>
            <h3>For the salad:</h3>
            <li>6 cups spring mix</li>
            <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced radishes</li>
            <li>1/2 cucumber, thiny sliced</li>
            <li>1 carrot, peeled and shredded on a box grater</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cherry or grape tomatoes, whole or halved lengthwise</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp shelled sunflower seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the vinaigrette ingredients into a jar with a tight sealing lid and shake until the dressing is creamy, about 1 minute. (If using garlic, let sit for at least 1 minute more to infuse flavor before serving.)</li><br>
            <li>Put the spring mix in a salad bowl and top with radishes, cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, and sunflower seeds.</li><br>
            <li>If serving immediately, pour the dressing over the top and mix gently to combine. If planning to save some for later, only add dressing to individual portions.</li>
        </ol><br>
    <p><b>Note:</b> This salad is wonderfully easy to customize. Use your favorite chopped nuts or seeds, chopped or grated vegetables, herbs, a little cheese, chopped apples, berries, or dried fruit. You could also turn this into a meal by adding grilled chicken, steak, or fish.</p>
    <p>You'll have enough dressing to make at least two salads. Save the extra in a jar in your fridge for up to 2 weeks. Let the oil come to room temperature, then shake it again well before using leftovers.</p>
