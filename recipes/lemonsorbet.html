        <p>This lemon sorbet is the most refreshing dessert. It's only 4 ingredients, and so easy to make for a sweet and tart summer dessert.</p>

        <h2>Tips and Tricks:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you don't have a fancy ice cream maker, you can still make this lemon sorbet. Use a metal loaf pan that has been chilled in the freezer for a few hours beforehand. Pour the base into this and return to the freezer. Remove the pan from the freezer every 30 minutes or so and stir it up as much as you can until the whole mixture is frozen. This will take about 2-3 hours total.</li><br>
            <li>A splash of vodka added to the sorbet helps prevent it from getting icy. About 1 Tablespoon should be enough. </li><br>
            <li>Add some chopped basil, mint, or rosemary to the sugar water as it steeps for a refreshing herb flavor added to your sorbet.</li><br>
            <li>Remove your sorbet from the freezer about 15 minutes before serving if it's been in the freezer for a while to help it soften enough to scoop it up. It'll be harder to scoop and more icy otherwise.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup lemon juice (fresh squeezed)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp lemon zest</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, add 1 cup water and sugar, heated over medium. Heat, stirring regularly until the sugar is dissolved.</li><br>
            <li>Add the remaining water, lemon juice, and lemon zest, and mix well. Let it chill at room temperature, or in the fridge until cool.</li><br>
            <li>Pour into prepared ice cream maker and let it run according to manufacturer's directions - about 25-30 minutes. (If you do not have an ice cream maker, see "Tips and Tricks" above.)</li><br>
            <li>Enjoy immediately, or scoop into a 2qt container and freeze for 6 hours or up to overnight to harden.</li><br>
            <li>Store any leftover sorbet in a covered container, up to a week in the freezer for best quality. Let it sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes before scooping and serving.</li></ol><br>
