        <p>Keftedes are meatballs from Greece. They are a blend of ground beef and lamb (or pork, if lamb is not available) with fresh mint, garlic, lemon, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, and more to create a well-seasoned meatball that is crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside. This is finished with a light, lemony sauce for an easy-to-make dinner your family will request again and again.</p>
        <p>They are usually served as an appetizer or as part of a large platter with pita bread, olives, and tzatziki, but they also make a delicious main meal over rice. For this recipe I will be serving with a tzatziki dipping sauce, recipe follows. Tzatziki is a delicious Greek sauce made with mint, cucumber, lemon, and lots of creamy Greek yogurt.</p>
        <p>Serve alongside a simple <a href="greeksalad.html">Greek Salad</a> for a delicious low-carb dinner.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>For the tzatziki:</h3>
            <li>3/4 English cucumber, partially peeled (striped)</li>
            <li>1 tsp kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>4-5 garlic cloves, peeled, finely grated or minced (start with less unless you like it strong)</li>
            <li>1 tsp white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cups plain Greek yogurt, preferably whole fat</li>
            <li>Handful of chopped fresh dill or mint</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground white pepper</li>
            <h3>For the meatballs:</h3>
            <li>1/3 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 slice day-old bread, cubed</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, grated</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground lamb or pork</li>
            <li>1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried Greek oregano <strong>(not Mexican oregano)</strong></li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>3 lemons, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>Flour for dredging</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups chicken stock</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>For the tzatziki:</h3>
            <li>Use a box grater to manually grate the cucumbers, or you can use a small food processor to finely chop the cucumbers. Toss the grated cucumbers with 1/2 tsp Kosher salt. Spoon the grated cucumber into a cheesecloth or double thickness paper towel and squeeze dry. (There will be a lot of liquid).</li><br>
            <li>In one large mixing bowl, place the garlic with remaining 1/2 tsp salt, white vinegar, and extra virgin olive oil. Stir to combine.</li><br>
            <li>Add the grated cucumber to the bowl with the garlic mixture. Stir in the yogurt, a pinch of white pepper, and the fresh herbs. Stir well to combine.</li><br>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving, and continue working on the meatballs. Chilling before serving will help thicken the sauce and give it the best texture, while allowing flavors to marry.</li><br>
            <li>When ready to serve, stir sauce to refresh.</li></ol>
            <ol><h3>For the meatballs:</h3>
            <li>Add the cubed bread to a bowl with the milk and let it soak for about 5 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and cook until golden and translucent, stirring regularly. Transfer the onions and garlic mixture to a large mixing bowl to cool. Set the skillet aside for later.</li><br>
            <li>Wring the excess milk out of the soaked bread. Add the bread to the mixing bowl.</li><br>
            <li>To the mixing bowl, add the ground beef and lamb (or pork), 1 egg, fresh mint, spices, salt and pepper, and 1 Tbsp lemon zest. Mix by hand until mixture is fully incorporated.</li><br>
            <li>Form the meat mixture into balls (each the size of a heaping tablespoon). Roll meatballs in the flour to lightly coat and place them on a large tray for now.</li><br>
            <li>In the large skillet you used earlier, add 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil. Heat over medium-high. Turn heat to medium and add the meatballs to cook (do this in batches if you need to).Cook meatballs for 10 minutes or so, turning occasionally, until fully cooked and well-crusted on all sides.</li><br>
            <li>With a slotted spoon, remove meatballs from the skillet onto paper towels to drain any excess fat. Meanwhile, carefully discard most of the cooking fat from the skillet (best to dump into a tin can until cooled).</li><br>
            <li>Whisk the egg yolk with chicken stock and lemon juice. Add to the skillet with the remaining lemon zest, then add the meatballs back in. Cook over medium heat for another 5 minutes until the lemon sauce thickens.</li><br>
            <li>Serve hot in bowls with pita bread, <a href="greeksalad.html">Greek salad</a>, and Tzatziki sauce.</li>
