        <p>In Greece, Horiatiki or Greek village salad, is served most often from early spring to the early part of fall. And it's truly the best use of the season's quality produce including juicy tomatoes, cucumbers, green bell peppers, and onions.</p>
        <p>Quality Greek kalamata olives and creamy feta cheese are a must in this salad. And the cheese is never crumbled, but served in large chunks or blocks crowning the breautiful fresh salad!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium red onion</li>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the red onion in half and thinly slice into half moons. (If you want to take the edge off, place the sliced onions in a solution of iced water and vinegar for about 10 minutes beofre adding to the salad.)</li><br>
            <li>Cut the tomatoes into wedges or large chunks.</li><br>
            <li>Cut the partially peeled cucumber in half lengthwise, then slice into thick halves (about 1/2" thickness).</li><br>
            <li>Thinly slice the bell pepper into rings.</li><br>
            <li>Place everything you've prepared so far in a large salad bowl. Add a good handful of pitted kalamata olives.</li><br>
            <li>Season lightly with kosher salt and a bit of dried oregano.</li><br>
            <li>Pour the olive oil and red wine vinegar all over the salad. Give everything a very gentle toss to mix. (<strong>Do not overmix.</strong> This salad is not meant to be handled too much.)</li><br>
            <li>Add the feta blocks on top and add a sprinkle more of dried oregano.</li><br>
            <li>Serve with crusty bread, or as an appetizer to an entree.</li></br>
